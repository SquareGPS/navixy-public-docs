  How the Input change events table detects discrete input changes and how to
  query it.
---

# Input change events

The Input change events transformation records every time a device's discrete input changes state and that change matches a configured `input_change` rule. Each row in `processed_common_data.input_change_events` represents one matched change: which input flipped, its new value, when and where it happened, and which rule it satisfied.

Unlike Driver performance events, which populates the instant a qualifying record is written, Input change events runs on a fixed schedule. A refresh function re-evaluates a window of raw data every 15 minutes, so a new row can lag up to 15 minutes behind the actual input change on the device.

{% hint style="info" %}
* All timestamps are stored in UTC.
* Only changes that match a configured `input_change` rule produce a row. Discrete input activity that doesn't match any rule is still available in `raw_telematics_data.additional_data`, just not surfaced here.
{% endhint %}

## Output table: processed\_common\_data.input\_change\_events

Each row represents one detected input change that matched an `input_change` rule. The table is keyed on `device_id`, `device_time`, and `rule_id`.

<table><thead><tr><th width="180">Field</th><th width="100">Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>device_id</code></td><td>integer</td><td>Device identifier.</td></tr><tr><td><code>object_id</code></td><td>integer</td><td>Object (vehicle/asset) identifier associated with the device.</td></tr><tr><td><code>object_label</code></td><td>text</td><td>Human-readable object name. Already denormalized into this table, so unlike Trips or Driver performance events, no join to <code>raw_business_data.objects</code> is needed to display it.</td></tr><tr><td><code>device_time</code></td><td>timestamp</td><td>Moment the input change occurred on the device.</td></tr><tr><td><code>rule_id</code></td><td>integer</td><td>Identifier of the <code>input_change</code> rule that matched.</td></tr><tr><td><code>input_number</code></td><td>integer</td><td>Input number, 1-based, matching the position in the <code>discrete_inputs</code> bit string in <code>raw_telematics_data.additional_data</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code>input_value</code></td><td>integer</td><td>New value of the input after the change: <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code>event_type</code></td><td>text</td><td>Always <code>input_change</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code>event_comment1</code></td><td>text</td><td>First comment configured on the matched rule.</td></tr><tr><td><code>event_comment2</code></td><td>text</td><td>Second comment configured on the matched rule.</td></tr><tr><td><code>zone_id</code></td><td>integer</td><td>Identifier of the geofence zone the device was in when the change occurred.

The examples below show common query patterns. The basic query returns recent input changes ordered by device and time. The second filters to a specific input number and value. The third filters to a specific rule.

## How input changes are detected

A row in this table isn't written the instant an input changes on the device. It is written on the next scheduled refresh, which re-evaluates a window of raw data against each device's last known state.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Scheduled refresh

Every 15 minutes, the refresh function reads the most recent window of rows from `raw_telematics_data.additional_data`.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Comparing against the last known state

Each device's current `discrete_inputs` and `discrete_outputs` bit strings are compared, bit by bit, against the state recorded on the previous refresh. Only bits that actually flipped are considered further.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Matching against rules

A flipped bit becomes a candidate event if its input number and new value match the condition configured on an `input_change` rule. See [Input triggering](../../../../../user-guide/guide/events-and-notifications/inputs-and-outputs/input-triggering.md) for how these rules are configured, and the [Rule types reference](https://navixy.com/docs/navixy-api/user-api/backend-api/resources/tracking/tracker/rules/rule_types) for the full list of rule types.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Zone check

If the matched rule is linked to a geofence, the refresh confirms the device was inside that zone at the time of the change before writing a row. Rules that aren't zone-linked skip this check.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Updating the last known state

Once a refresh completes, each device's latest bit state is recorded for comparison on the next run.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Customizing

Input change events isn't customized through a Transformation Builder workflow the way Trips or Driver performance events are. The rows that appear here directly reflect whichever `input_change` rules are configured on your account: to change what gets recorded, add, edit, or remove the corresponding rules rather than a transformation template. See [Input triggering](../../../../../user-guide/guide/events-and-notifications/inputs-and-outputs/input-triggering.md) for how to configure these rules.

## Next steps

* [**Common transformations**](./): Back to the transformation index.
* [**Trips**](trips.md): A sibling transformation that also runs on a schedule against raw telematics data.
* [**Driver performance events**](driver-performance-events.md): A sibling transformation triggered instantly instead of on a schedule.
* [**Raw data layer**](../../bronze-layer.md): Explore `additional_data`, the source table that feeds Input change events.
* [**Input triggering**](../../../../../user-guide/guide/events-and-notifications/inputs-and-outputs/input-triggering.md): Configure the `input_change` rules that determine which input changes are recorded here.
